# CodeClauseInternship_Random-Password-Generator


The "Random Password Generator" project in Python aims to deliver a versatile and user-friendly tool for creating secure passwords. Through the integration of the `random` and `string` modules, the program generates passwords of customizable length, encompassing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols to enhance security. Users are actively engaged in the process, given the ability to specify the desired password length and choose the inclusion of different character types. An additional feature enables users to save generated passwords to a file for future use. The script incorporates error handling to notify users if they attempt to generate a password without selecting any character types. With a focus on modularity, the code is organized into functions, promoting readability and facilitating future enhancements. Beyond its functionality, the project addresses security considerations by providing a balanced mix of character types to ensure robust password strength. This project not only provides a practical solution but also offers a customizable and interactive interface, empowering users to tailor their passwords for various applications.
